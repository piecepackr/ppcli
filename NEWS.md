ppcli 0.1.0 (development)
=========================

* ``cat_piece()`` prints out Unicode plaintext boardgame diagrams.

  + It supports the same data frame arguments also supported by 
    ``piecepackr::pmap_piece()`` / ``piecepackr::render_piece()``
    as well as the board game setup functions in `{ppdf}`.
  + It is an extraction and refinement of ``ppgames::cat_piece()``.

* ``str_piece()`` computes the character vector of Unicode plaintext boardgame diagrams (#1).
